hi.. sorry to contact you in this way, but didn't see another possibility.

I like the ideas you have started to implement in your fork of decluttarr (support for other torrent managers, support for multi-instances)

I wanted to reach out and ask if you would like to contribute by adding PRs and bringing these great ideas to the main repo of decluttar?
While personally I won't use it, I am sure others would benefit from it, given these things have been requested a number of times.

Cheers
